			<h3>Main Media</h3>
			<p>In the current time, the philippine science high school system has decided to implement a bunch of rules, some of which caused outrage by the students. These rules are also constantly criticized for its "conservative thought" like for example  holding hands becoming a form of public display of affection. Are these new rules a really smart approach for discipline, or is it just the root of protest? 
			<br><br>
			Well first of all these rules are simply excessive in my opinion. Excessive in the way that it fails to convey the reason why it's implemented. Let's go back to the pda rule (see first paragraph). As we can see, the message we can clearly infer from this set of rules regarding displaying affection in public is that it's illegal or it can cause several offenses. However, there are other rules they included such as "hugging someone or simply holding someone's hand can get you an offense." As an institution of learning, support, and care the students will most likely cause an outrage, and they have the right to as well. 
			<br><br>
			Another rule implemented in the school is the gadget ban. Yes, the gadget ban. It seems as this rule is very self-explanatory to why this is being implemented considering there are other students who abuse gadget usage in class. However, the gadget ban wasnt always compatible and agreeable for everyone. For example again, there had been cases of "power abuse" or simply authorities abusing their power. There was a situation (that I also witnessed) before wherein the student, who used his cellphone long past the time the ban ended, had his respective gadget confiscated by the authority (teacher). This did not even happen in class, nor even in the shb. It happened in the ASTB hall (a non restricted area to use gadgets for important purooses). I can see the student facing down as the authority scolds him for "disobeying" the rules that he did not even disobey. This power abuse however, does not just go to the gadget ban, but to all the other rules. I only emphasized it here because of how the "older people" were being very determined to take away gadgets no matter the reason, as from a perspective of the student.
			<br><br>
			In conclusion, these implemented rules are acceptable or agreeable but some of their aspects should be changed before it becomes the root of many different controversies in the school regarding the system and the students themselves.
